\/\The Conscience of a Hacker/\/ by &#43;&#43;&#43;The Mentor&#43;&#43;&#43; Written on January 8, 1986 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Another one got caught today, it&#39;s all over the papers. &#34;Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&#34;, “Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering”…
Damn kids. They’re all alike.
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950&#39;s technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
I am a hacker, enter my world…
Mine is a world that begins with school… I’m smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me…
Damn underachiever. They’re all alike.">

</code></pre>
<p>Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &ldquo;Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering&rdquo;&hellip;<br>
Damn kids.  They&rsquo;re all alike.</p>
<pre><code>    But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,   
</code></pre>
<p>ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what<br>
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br>
I am a hacker, enter my world&hellip;<br>
Mine is a world that begins with school&hellip; I&rsquo;m smarter than most of<br>
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me&hellip;<br>
Damn underachiever.  They&rsquo;re all alike.</p>
<pre><code>    I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain   
</code></pre>
<p>for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  &ldquo;No, Ms.<br>
Smith, I didn&rsquo;t show my work.  I did it in my head&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They&rsquo;re all alike.</p>
<pre><code>    I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is   
</code></pre>
<p>cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it&rsquo;s because I<br>
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn&rsquo;t like me&hellip;<br>
Or feels threatened by me&hellip;<br>
Or thinks I&rsquo;m a smart ass&hellip;<br>
Or doesn&rsquo;t like teaching and shouldn&rsquo;t be here&hellip;<br>
Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They&rsquo;re all alike.</p>
<pre><code>    And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through   
</code></pre>
<p>the phone line like heroin through an addict&rsquo;s veins, an electronic pulse is<br>
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought&hellip; a board is<br>
found.<br>
&ldquo;This is it&hellip; this is where I belong&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
I know everyone here&hellip; even if I&rsquo;ve never met them, never talked to<br>
them, may never hear from them again&hellip; I know you all&hellip;<br>
Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They&rsquo;re all alike&hellip;</p>
<pre><code>    You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at   
</code></pre>
<p>school when we hungered for steak&hellip; the bits of meat that you did let slip<br>
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We&rsquo;ve been dominated by sadists, or<br>
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-<br>
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.</p>
<pre><code>    This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the   
</code></pre>
<p>beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying<br>
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&rsquo;t run by profiteering gluttons, and<br>
you call us criminals.  We explore&hellip; and you call us criminals.  We seek<br>
after knowledge&hellip; and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,<br>
without nationality, without religious bias&hellip; and you call us criminals.<br>
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us<br>
and try to make us believe it&rsquo;s for our own good, yet we&rsquo;re the criminals.</p>
<pre><code>    Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is   
</code></pre>
<p>that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.<br>
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me<br>
for.</p>
<pre><code>    I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,   
</code></pre>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t stop us all&hellip; after all, we&rsquo;re all alike.</p>
