Migrate Media Storage to S3: Why it’s critical: Offloading media files to an object storage service like S3 prevents your server from being bogged down by large file uploads and downloads. This step alone will drastically reduce server load and allow your app to handle a larger number of users. Scalability Benefit: S3 automatically scales, ensuring you can store as many files as needed without server capacity issues.">

<p>Migrate Media Storage to S3:
Why it&rsquo;s critical: Offloading media files to an object storage service like S3 prevents your server from being bogged down by large file uploads and downloads. This step alone will drastically reduce server load and allow your app to handle a larger number of users.
Scalability Benefit: S3 automatically scales, ensuring you can store as many files as needed without server capacity issues.</p>

<p>Implement a Task Queue (e.g., Celery):
Why it&rsquo;s critical: Asynchronous processing via a task queue allows heavy operations (like video processing or media conversions) to be done in the background without affecting the user experience.
Scalability Benefit: Offloading resource-intensive tasks ensures your app can handle many concurrent users, as it removes bottlenecks from blocking processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set Up Auto-Scaling and Containerization:
Why it&rsquo;s critical: With containerization (e.g., Docker) and auto-scaling (using AWS or another provider), your application will dynamically scale to meet demand, adding more instances when traffic increases.
Scalability Benefit: This ensures your infrastructure grows with demand, preventing slowdowns or downtime during traffic surges</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>.
4. Add Caching for Database Queries and Move Static Content to a CDN:
Why it&rsquo;s critical: Caching frequently used data reduces database load, speeding up response times. Using a CDN offloads static assets (like images, CSS, JS) from your server, making content delivery faster globally.
Scalability Benefit: Caching optimizes database performance, and a CDN reduces latency for global users, improving the overall scalability of your app.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Optimize Your Database (Indexing, Backups):
Why it&rsquo;s critical: Proper indexing ensures that database queries are as efficient as possible, while automated backups protect your data. As your app scales, more users will interact with the database, and efficient queries are essential.
Scalability Benefit: Optimizing your database will prevent performance degradation as data grows, ensuring your app remains responsive.</li>
</ol>
<p>I need someone who can implement this on my code fast</p>
