There are a few issues you need to overcome to have this work.
When cmake is run any version information you extract from subversion is baked into the generated build files, and so becomes static. Cmake is only rerun if it detects the generated build files have become out of date (eg: if a CMakeLists.txt file is updated) You can create a custom_target which will be run every time you build (from the docs: “The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE”) which generates the file, but that will force you to rebuild your generated version file every time.">
